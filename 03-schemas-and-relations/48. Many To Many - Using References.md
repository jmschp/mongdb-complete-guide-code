# 48. Many To Many - Using References

In situation that we have two collections, that might be regularly updated, it might be better to use references than embedded documents. For example, suppose that we have two collections, Books, and Authors, a book can have many authors, and a author can write many books. Instead of embedding the authors documents, within the book document, we can reference it.

**Authors Collection:**

```javascript
db.authors.insertMany([
  {
    name: "J.R.R. Tolkien",
    biography: "A famous fantasy author...",
  },
  {
    name: "Miguel",
  },
  {
    name: "Jane Austen",
    biography: "...",
  },
]);

// saves author data

[
  {
    _id: ObjectId("65fdac70f971fe0d2d6b74f6"),
    name: "J.R.R. Tolkien",
    biography: "A famous fantasy author...",
  },
  {
    _id: ObjectId("65fdac76f971fe0d2d6b74f7"),
    name: "Miguel",
  },
  {
    _id: ObjectId("65fdad90f971fe0d2d6b74fa"),
    name: "Jane Austen",
    biography: "...",
  },
];
```

**Explanation:**

- The `Authors` collection stores information about each author.

**Books Collection:**

```javascript
db.books.insertMany([
  {
    title: "The Lord of the Rings",
    genre: "Fantasy",
    author_ids: [ObjectId("65fdac70f971fe0d2d6b74f6"), ObjectId("65fdac76f971fe0d2d6b74f7")],
  },
  {
    title: "Pride and Prejudice",
    genre: "Romance",
    author_ids: [ObjectId("65fdad90f971fe0d2d6b74fa")],
  },
]);

// Saves book data
[
  {
    _id: ObjectId("65fdac90f971fe0d2d6b74f8"),
    title: "The Lord of the Rings",
    genre: "Fantasy",
    author_ids: [ObjectId("65fdac70f971fe0d2d6b74f6"), ObjectId("65fdac76f971fe0d2d6b74f7")],
  },
  {
    _id: ObjectId("65fdac92f971fe0d2d6b74f9"),
    title: "Pride and Prejudice",
    genre: "Romance",
    author_ids: [ObjectId("65fdad90f971fe0d2d6b74fa")],
  },
];
```

**Explanation:**

- The `Books` collection stores information about each book.
- We include an `author_ids` array that holds `ObjectIds` referencing authors in the `Authors` collection.
- A book can have multiple authors listed in the `author_ids` array (Many-to-Many relationship).

**Benefits:**

- **Reduced Duplication:** Author information is stored only once, avoiding duplication in each book document.
- **Data Consistency:** Updates to author information (e.g., biography) are reflected in all related books.
- **Flexibility:** You can easily add new authors or books without modifying existing documents.

**Drawbacks:**

- **More Complex Schema:** Requires managing references between collections.
- **Potentially Slower Queries:** Retrieving a book's full list of authors might require additional lookups in the `Authors` collection.

**Fetching Data:**

You can use the `$lookup` aggregation pipeline stage or populate methods in your application framework to efficiently retrieve a book's complete information, including its authors' details, in a single query.

**Choosing the Right Approach:**

This approach with references is generally recommended for Many-to-Many relationships in MongoDB due to the benefits of data integrity, flexibility, and efficient updates. It offers a good balance between schema complexity and query performance.
