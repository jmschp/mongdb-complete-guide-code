# 41. How to Derive your Data Structure - Requirements

## Document Structure

- **Start with Entities:** Identify the core entities (documents) in your data domain. These could be users, products, orders, etc.
- **Define Relationships:** Analyze the relationships between these entities. Do they have one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many relationships?
- **Nesting vs. Referencing:** Decide between embedding related data within documents (nesting) or storing them in separate collections with references (using ObjectIds). Nesting is suitable for one-to-one or one-to-few relationships, while references are better for many-to-many or complex hierarchies.
- **Denormalization:** Consider denormalizing your data by strategically including some redundancy to improve query performance. This can involve embedding frequently accessed data from related entities for faster retrieval. However, maintain data consistency when updating denormalized fields.

## Data Types

- **Choose Appropriate Types:** Select the most suitable data type (e.g., string, integer, date) for each field based on the kind of data it represents. This ensures efficient storage and querying.
- **Consider Future Needs:** Think about potential future requirements and choose data types that can accommodate them. For example, if you might need to store high-precision numbers later, consider using Decimal128.

## Query Patterns

- **Anticipate Queries:** Analyze how you will typically query and retrieve your data. Structure your documents and schema to facilitate efficient execution of those queries. Consider using indexes on frequently queried fields to optimize performance.
- **Aggregation vs. Lookup Stages:** If you need to combine data from multiple collections, explore using the aggregation framework's lookup stages or joining collections with references when appropriate.

## Additional Considerations

- **Normalization vs. Denormalization:** There's a trade-off between normalization (reducing redundancy) and denormalization (adding redundancy for performance). Strike a balance based on your specific needs and query patterns.
- **Scalability:** Design your schema with scalability in mind. Consider potential data growth and how your structure will accommodate it. Sharding may be necessary for very large collections.
- **Validation Rules:** Implement validation rules on your collections to ensure data integrity and consistency. This can be done using Mongoose in your application or through MongoDB schema validation features.

Remember, data modeling is an iterative process. As your application evolves and your data needs change, you might need to refine your schema. Start with a solid foundation based on these principles, and adapt it as needed for your specific use case.
