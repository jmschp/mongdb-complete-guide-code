# 47. Many To Many - Embedded

Imagine a E-commerce application, where we have customer, and products. One customer can buy multiple products and a product can be bought by multiple customer. In a traditional SQL approach we would have a orders join table, but in MongoDB, depending on applications needs we could nest the orders in the customer document.

## Approach nesting Order, but referencing products

```javascript
db.products.insertMany([
  { name: "A book", price: 9.99 },
  { name: "Another book", price: 50 },
]);

// Would save to products dor the products collections
[
  { _id: ObjectId("65f5c5ca67ca7c271e8e7db0"), name: "A book", price: 9.99 },
  { _id: ObjectId("65f5c5ca67ca7c271e8e7db1"), name: "Another book", price: 50 },
];

db.customers.insertOne({
  name: "John Doe",
  email: "john.doe@example.com",
  orders: [
    {
      product_id: ObjectId("65f5c5ca67ca7c271e8e7db0"),
      quantity: 2,
      price: 19.98, // Price at the time of purchase
    },
    {
      product_id: ObjectId("65f5c5ca67ca7c271e8e7db1"),
      quantity: 1,
      price: 50, // Price at the time of purchase
    },
  ],
});
```

**Explanation:**

- We have a `customer` document with basic customer information.
- Instead of a separate collection for orders, we embed an `orders` array within the `customer` document.
- Each order object within the array represents a product purchased by the customer.
- The order object includes:
  - `product_id`: A reference to the product using its ObjectId.
  - `quantity`: The number of units of that product purchased in this order.
  - `price`: The price of the product at the time of purchase (useful for tracking historical purchases).

**Benefits:**

- **Simpler Schema:** Embedding keeps related data (customer and order details) together, simplifying the schema.
- **Efficient Retrieval:** When fetching a customer's details, you can also retrieve their purchase history in a single query.

**Drawbacks:**

- **Data Duplication:** Product price information is duplicated within each order object if it changes over time.
- **Limited Product Updates:** Updating product information (e.g., price) won't reflect in past orders.

## Approach nesting Order and products

```javascript
db.products.insertMany([
  { name: "A book", price: 9.99 },
  { name: "Another book", price: 50 },
]);

// Would save to products dor the products collections
[
  { _id: ObjectId("65f5c5ca67ca7c271e8e7db0"), name: "A book", price: 9.99 },
  { _id: ObjectId("65f5c5ca67ca7c271e8e7db1"), name: "Another book", price: 50 },
];

db.customers.insertOne({
  name: "John Doe",
  email: "john.doe@example.com",
  orders: [
    {
      productName: "A book",
      quantity: 2,
      unitPrice: 9.99
      total: 19.98, // Price at the time of purchase
    },
    {
      productName: "Another book",
      quantity: 1,
      unitPrice: 50
      total: 50, // Price at the time of purchase
    },
  ],
});
```

In this approach all the data is nested, within the customer document, and not referenced. this way in a single query we can obtain all the information about the customer orders and products.

## Alternative: Referencing with Separate Collections

```javascript
db.products.insertMany([
  { name: "A book", price: 9.99 },
  { name: "Another book", price: 50 },
]);

// Would save to products dor the products collections
[
  { _id: ObjectId("65f5c5ca67ca7c271e8e7db0"), name: "A book", price: 9.99 },
  { _id: ObjectId("65f5c5ca67ca7c271e8e7db1"), name: "Another book", price: 50 },
];

db.customers.insertOne({ name: "John Doe", email: "john.doe@example.com" });

// Would save a customer to the database
[{ _id: ObjectId("65f5c6d567ca7c271e8e7db2"), name: "John Doe", email: "john.doe@example.com" }];

db.orders.insertMany([
  {
    productId: ObjectId("65f5c5ca67ca7c271e8e7db0"),
    customerId: ObjectId("65f5c6d567ca7c271e8e7db2"),
    quantity: 2,
    price: 19.98, // Price at the time of purchase
  },
  {
    productId: ObjectId("65f5c5ca67ca7c271e8e7db1"),
    customerId: ObjectId("65f5c6d567ca7c271e8e7db2"),
    quantity: 1,
    price: 50, // Price at the time of purchase
  },
]);
```

An alternative approach is to use separate collections with references:

- **Customer Collection:** Similar structure, but without the `orders` array.
- **Order Collection:**
  - `customer_id`: Reference to the customer ObjectId.
  - `product_id`: Reference to the product ObjectId.
  - `quantity`: Similar to the embedded approach.
  - `price`: Similar to the embedded approach.
- **Product Collection:** Similar structure.

**Benefits:**

- **Reduced Duplication:** Product information is stored once, avoiding duplication.
- **Centralized Product Updates:** Updates to product information (e.g., price) are reflected in all related orders.

**Drawbacks:**

- **More Complex Schema:** Requires managing references between collections.
- **Potentially Slower Queries:** Retrieving a customer's full purchase history might require additional joins or lookups.

## Choosing the Right Approach

The best approach (embedding vs. referencing) depends on your specific needs:

- **Choose embedding** if you frequently need to retrieve a customer's details and their complete purchase history in a single query, and product updates are less frequent.
- **Choose referencing** if data consistency across all orders for a product is crucial, and you can tolerate potentially slower queries for retrieving complete purchase history.

You can always evaluate and adapt your approach based on your application's usage patterns and query requirements.
