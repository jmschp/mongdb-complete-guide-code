# 38. Data Types - An Overview

MongoDB Server use a BSON format to store data, that allows for more data types than JSON.

To deal with number Numbers we have the following Data Types:

- Integer (int32): 32-bit signed integer.
- Long (int64): 64-bit signed integer.
- Decimal128: a high-precision decimal.

Other Data Types:

- ObjectId: 24-character, big-endian hexadecimal string that represents the ObjectId bytes. Generated by MongoDB upon insertion of each document.
- Date: Represents a date and time value. MongoDB stores dates internally as milliseconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC).
- Timestamp: A 64-bit value representing a point in time with nanosecond precision.
