# 45. One To Many - Embedded

We could have a Q&A application where users post questions and each question can have multiple answers. This could be a case for a One To Many relations using embedded documents. So we would have have a questions collection, and embedded in it the answers documents.

From an application perspective when we fetch the questions we usually also want the answers, so thats why it would make sense to use a embedded relation.

```javascript
db.questions.insertOne({
  user_id: "some id of the user who created the question",
  title: "The questions title",
  body: "The question body",
  tags: ["ruby on rails", "mongodb"],
  answers: [
    {
      body: "This works like something else",
      user_id: "some id of the user who created the question",
    },
    {
      body: "This works like that",
      user_id: "some id of the user who created the question",
    },
  ],
});
```
