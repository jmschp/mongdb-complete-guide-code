# 46. One To Many - Using References

Suppose we are building an application for government administration, where we have all the citizens and the cities they live in. So one city can have multiple citizens, and a citizen lives in one city. In this use case nesting the citizens within the cities document could be a bad idea. Suppose that there are situations the we only want to work with cities data, having the nested citizens would make our queries heavy, and dealing with so much data, we could reach the 16 Mb per document limit in our cities.

```javascript
db.cities.insertOne({ name: "Porto", mayor: "Rui Mayor" });
// Will save
// { _id: ObjectId("65f5bf0967ca7c271e8e7da8"), name: "Porto", mayor: "Rui Mayor", }

db.citizens.insertMany([
  {
    name: "Miguel",
    birthDate: new Date(1983, 6, 30),
    cityId: ObjectId("65f5bf0967ca7c271e8e7da8"),
  },
  {
    name: "Viviane",
    birthDate: new Date(1984, 2, 17),
    cityId: ObjectId("65f5bf0967ca7c271e8e7da8"),
  },
]);

// Will save to citizens
[
  {
    _id: ObjectId("65f5bf8367ca7c271e8e7da9"),
    name: "Miguel",
    birthDate: ISODate("1983-07-29T23:00:00.000Z"),
    cityId: ObjectId("65f5bf0967ca7c271e8e7da8"),
  },
  {
    _id: ObjectId("65f5bf8367ca7c271e8e7daa"),
    name: "Viviane",
    birthDate: ISODate("1984-03-17T00:00:00.000Z"),
    cityId: ObjectId("65f5bf0967ca7c271e8e7da8"),
  },
];
