# 44. One To One - Using References

As an example for a One to One relation using references, we could have an application where we have a people collection, and each person has one car, but we don't need to query then together, we are only interested in analyzing the cars data. So we could split then into two collections.

```javascript
db.people.insertOne({ name: 'Miguel', age: 40, salary: 60000})
// wil save to the database.
{
  _id: ObjectId('65f5b1e267ca7c271e8e7da5'),
  name: 'Miguel',
  age: 40,
  salary: 60000
}

// We can then use the person _id to create the car.
db.cars.insertOne({model: 'Jaguar', price: 60000, person_id: ObjectId('65f5b1e267ca7c271e8e7da5')})
{
  _id: ObjectId('65f5b22167ca7c271e8e7da6'),
  model: 'Jaguar',
  price: 60000,
  person_id: ObjectId('65f5b1e267ca7c271e8e7da5')
}
```
