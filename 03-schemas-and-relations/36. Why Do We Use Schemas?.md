# 36. Why Do We Use Schemas?

Although MongoDB it self does not enforce any kind of schema, which means that in the same collection we can have totally different documents, for most real use cases we will need some kind of schema.

If for example we are building an online shop, we will likely have a collection named `products`, and we are going to have some schema definition, like for example all `products` will have a `name` and a `price`.
