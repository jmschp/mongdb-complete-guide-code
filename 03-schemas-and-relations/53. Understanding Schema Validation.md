# 53. Understanding Schema Validation

MongoDB is a very flexible database system, by default it does not enforce fields or data types in a collection. Nevertheless, it is possible to use schema validation to enforce necessary rules to keep data consistency.

We can have different validation level:

- strict: checks all insert update operations
- moderate: All insert operation are checked, but for update if a document is invalid, but already saved, validation is skipped.

When a validation fails we can take two actions:

- Throw an error, and prevent the operation, no data is saved
- Log a warning, but still persist the data
