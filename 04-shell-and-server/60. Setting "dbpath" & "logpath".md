# 60. Setting "dbpath" & "logpath"

## logpath

The option `logpath` specifies the file to which MongoDB Server is going to log. It needs to be the path to a file and not a folder.

```text
sudo mongod --logpath /Users/some-user/path/to/log/file/log.log
```

With Homebrew installation default is `/opt/homebrew/var/log/mongodb/mongo.log`

## dbpath

With the `dbpath` option we can configure where MongoDB Server is going to save the datafiles

```text
sudo mongod --dbpath /Users/some-user/path/to/folder/
```

With Homebrew installation default is `/opt/homebrew/var/mongodb`
