# 62. MongoDB as a Background Service

On MacOS if we installed MongDB with Homebrew, we can run the MongoDB Server, with `brew services start mongodb-community`. This will execute MongoDB Server as a background process. The same could be achieved with the `--fork` option using the command `mongod --dbpath /path/to/dbdir --logpath /path/to/mongodb.log --fork`.

If we started MongoDB Server with the `--fork` option, we can shut it down with `db.adminCommand({ shutdown: 1})`, or `db.shutdownServer()`, both comands should be issued against the admin database.
