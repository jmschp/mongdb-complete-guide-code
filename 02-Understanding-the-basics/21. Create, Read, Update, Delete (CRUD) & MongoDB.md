# 21. Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) & MongoDB

With the MongoDB Shell we can interact with the MongoDB Server database, there are several methods to perfom CRUD operations.

## Create

In `mongosh`, the official MongoDB shell, inserting documents into a collection can be achieved through two primary methods: `insertOne()` and `insertMany()`. Both methods serve the purpose of adding data to your MongoDB database, but they cater to different scenarios and have distinct functionalities:

### insertOne()

- **Purpose:** Inserts **a single document** into a specified collection.
- **Syntax:**

```javascript
db.collection.insertOne(document, options);
```

- **Example:**

```javascript
db.products.insertOne({ name: "T-Shirt", price: 19.99, color: "Blue", size: "M" });
```

- **Key points:**
  - This method is ideal for inserting individual documents one at a time.
  - It returns an object containing details about the inserted document, including its generated `_id`.

### insertMany()

- **Purpose:** Inserts **multiple documents** into a specified collection in a single operation.
- **Syntax:**

```javascript
db.collection.insertMany(documents, options);
```

- **Example:**

```javascript
db.products.insertMany([
  { name: "Hat", price: 14.99, color: "Black" },
  { name: "Jeans", price: 39.99, size: "32" },
  { name: "Dress", price: 49.99, size: "S" },
]);
```

- **Key points:**
  - This method is efficient for inserting large batches of documents simultaneously.
  - It accepts an array containing the documents to be inserted.
  - It returns an object with an `insertedIds` field, where each element represents the generated `_id` for the corresponding inserted document.

### Choosing the right method

Selecting the suitable method depends on the number of documents you want to insert:

- **Use `insertOne()` when:**
  - You need to insert only one document at a time.
  - You require detailed information about the inserted document, including its `_id`.
- **Use `insertMany()` when:**
  - You have a large number of documents to insert efficiently.
  - You don't require individual information about each inserted document, only the generated `_ids`.

- [db.collection.insertOne()](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.collection.insertOne/)
- [db.collection.insertMany()](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.collection.insertMany/)

## Read

In `mongosh`, the official MongoDB shell, finding documents in a collection involves two critical methods: `find()` and `findOne()`. Both methods serve the purpose of retrieving data from your MongoDB database, but they address different search requirements:

### find()

- **Purpose:** Returns a **cursor** that iterates over documents in a collection **matching a specific query criteria**.
- **Syntax:**

```javascript
db.collection.find(query, projection);
```

- **Example:**

```javascript
db.products.find({ price: { $gt: 20 } }); // find products with price > 20
```

- **Key points:**
  - This method can return multiple documents that satisfy the given query.
  - You can optionally specify a `query` object to filter results based on specific criteria.
  - A `projection` object can be used to select specific fields to be returned for each document.
  - The returned cursor allows you to iterate over the results document by document using methods like `forEach()` or `toArray()`.

### findOne()

- **Purpose:** Returns **a single document** that **first satisfies the specified query criteria**.
- **Syntax:**

```javascript
db.collection.findOne(query, projection);
```

- **Example:**

```javascript
db.products.findOne({ name: "T-Shirt" }); // find the first product named "T-Shirt"
```

- **Key points:**
  - This method only returns one document, even if multiple documents match the query.
  - It utilizes the same optional `query` and `projection` objects as `find()`.
  - If no document matches the query, it returns `null`.

### Choosing the right method

Selecting the appropriate method depends on your search requirements:

- **Use `find()` when:**
  - You need to retrieve **multiple documents** that match a specific criteria.
  - You want to iterate over the results and potentially manipulate them individually.
- **Use `findOne()` when:**
  - You only need the **first document** that matches a specific criteria.
  - You're looking for a specific document by its unique identifier or other unique attribute.

Remember, both `find()` and `findOne()` offer powerful functionalities for searching and retrieving data from your MongoDB collections. Choose based on whether you need a single document matching a specific criterion or a set of documents based on broader search criteria.

## Update

In mongosh, the official MongoDB shell, modifying existing data within a collection involves three key methods: `updateOne()`, `updateMany()`, and `replaceOne()`. Each method serves a distinct purpose in updating documents, providing flexibility for various scenarios:

### updateOne()

- **Purpose:** Updates a **single document** that **matches a specific query criteria**.
- **Syntax:**

```javascript
db.collection.updateOne(filter, update, options);
```

- **Example:**

```javascript
db.products.updateOne({ name: "T-Shirt" }, { $set: { price: 15.99 } }); // Update price for the first product named "T-Shirt"
```

- **Key points:**
  - This method updates at most one document that matches the provided query criteria.
  - It utilizes two key arguments:
    - `filter`: Specifies the criteria for selecting the document to be updated.
    - `update`: Defines the modifications to be applied to the selected document. You can use various update operators like `$set`, `$inc`, `$unset`, etc.
  - It returns an object indicating the update operation's outcome, including the number of matched and modified documents.

### updateMany()

- **Purpose:** Updates **multiple documents** that **match a specific query criteria**.
- **Syntax:**

```javascript
db.collection.updateMany(filter, update, options);
```

- **Example:**

```javascript
db.products.updateMany({ price: { $lt: 20 } }, { $set: { onSale: true } }); // Mark all products with price < 20 as on sale
```

- **Key points:**
  - This method can potentially update several documents based on the provided query.
  - It shares the same syntax and arguments as `updateOne()`.
  - It returns an object summarizing the update operation, including the number of matched and modified documents.

### replaceOne()

- **Purpose:** Replaces a **single document** that **matches a specific query criteria** with an entirely new document.
- **Syntax:**

```javascript
db.collection.replaceOne(filter, replacement, options);
```

- **Example:**

```javascript
db.products.replaceOne({ name: "Jeans" }, { name: "Pants", size: ["S", "M", "L"] }); // Replace entire document for the first product named "Jeans"
```

- **Key points:**
  - This method essentially replaces the entire document matching the query with the provided replacement document.
  - It utilizes similar arguments as `updateOne()`:
    - `filter`: Specifies the criteria for selecting the document to be replaced.
    - `replacement`: Represents the new document that will replace the existing one.
  - It returns an object indicating the update operation's outcome, including the number of matched and replaced documents.

### Choosing the right method

The best method depends on the extent of your update and the number of documents you want to modify:

- **Use `updateOne()` when:**
  - You need to update **specific fields** within a single document based on a query criterion.
- **Use `updateMany()` when:**
  - You want to apply the same **modifications** to **multiple documents** matching a specific query.
- **Use `replaceOne()` when:**
  - You intend to **completely replace** a single document with an entirely new document structure and values.

- [db.collection.replaceOne()](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.collection.replaceOne/)

## Delete

In `mongosh`, the official MongoDB shell, deleting unwanted data from a collection involves two primary methods: `deleteOne()` and `deleteMany()`. Each method fulfills specific requirements for data removal:

### deleteOne()

- **Purpose:** Deletes the **first document** that matches a specified query filter.
- **Syntax:**

```javascript
db.collection.deleteOne(filter, options);
```

- **Arguments:**
  - `filter` (required): A document defining the criteria to identify the document to delete.
- **Return value:**
  - Returns an object with information about the delete operation, including the number of deleted documents (ideally 1 in this case).
- **Example:**

```javascript
db.products.deleteOne({ name: "T-Shirt" }); // Delete the first product named "T-Shirt"
```

### deleteMany()

- **Purpose:** Deletes **all documents** that match a specified query filter.
- **Syntax:**

```javascript
db.collection.deleteMany(filter, options);
```

- **Arguments:**
  - `filter` (required): Same as `deleteOne()`.
- **Return value:**
  - Returns an object with details about the delete operation, including the number of deleted documents (potentially more than 1 for this method).
- **Example:**

```javascript
db.products.deleteMany({ price: { $lt: 15 } }); // Delete all products with price less than $15
```

### Choosing the right method

Selecting the suitable method depends on the extent of deletion you intend:

- **Use `deleteOne()` when:**
  - You need to delete a **single document** that satisfies a specific criteria.
  - You want to ensure precise removal of only the targeted document.
- **Use `deleteMany()` when:**

  - You intend to delete **multiple documents** matching a specific criteria.
  - You have a set of documents you want to remove based on certain conditions.
