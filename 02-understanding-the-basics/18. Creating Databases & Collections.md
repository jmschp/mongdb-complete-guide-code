# 18. Creating Databases & Collections

Within the MongoDB Shell we can run the `use database_name` command to select a specific database to work with. If the database does not exist yet, it will be created when we insert data into it. in the same way if a collection does not exist, MongoDB creates the collection when you first store data for that collection.

```javascript
use shop
// switched to db shop, if it does not exist database will actually be created once we insert data into it

db.products.insertOne({name: "Product 1", description: "some description"})
// creates products collection if it does not exists and inserts one document into it

{
  acknowledged: true,
  insertedId: ObjectId('65e0c9ec336ff480bf26be9e')
}
// Document was inserted and an unique ID was assigned to it
```
