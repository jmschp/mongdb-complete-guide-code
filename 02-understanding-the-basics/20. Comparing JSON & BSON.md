# 20. Comparing JSON & BSON

In MongoDB, **BSON** stands for **Binary JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**. It's a **binary-encoded serialization format** used to store documents and make remote procedure calls within the database.

## What is BSON

- BSON serves as the **native data format** for MongoDB, meaning it's how data is stored and transmitted within the database.
- It resembles **JSON** (used for data interchange) but utilizes a **binary representation** for efficiency.
- BSON offers several **advantages over JSON**:
  - **Compactness:** BSON is often smaller than JSON for storing the same data due to its efficient binary encoding.
  - **Richer data types:** BSON supports a wider range of data types compared to JSON, including dates, binary data, and ObjectIds (unique identifiers used by MongoDB).
  - **Faster processing:** BSON's binary structure allows for faster data parsing and manipulation within the database compared to text-based JSON.

## How BSON works

- Documents in MongoDB consist of **key-value pairs**, where keys are strings and values can be various data types.
- When you insert data into MongoDB, it automatically converts the data from its original format (e.g., JavaScript objects) into BSON behind the scenes.
- Similarly, when you retrieve data from MongoDB, it delivers the data in BSON format. You can then use the MongoDB driver or libraries for your programming language to convert it back to a usable format, often similar to the original type.

## Things to remember about BSON

- You don't typically need to directly work with BSON in your code, as the MongoDB driver handles the conversion automatically.
- Although you can't directly store JSON data in MongoDB, there are tools and libraries available to convert between JSON and BSON if needed.
