# 16. Understanding Databases, Collections & Documents

Within our MongoDB server we can have several databases. Each database can hold multiple collections (equivalente to tables in SQL). And in each collection we can have several documents (the rows in a SQL table).

When working with MongoDB each piece of infomation either a database, collection or document, can be create implicitly. For example, when running the command `use shop` in `mongosh` which says to use the the database named `shop`, this will implicitly create the database if it does not exist.
