# 27. Understanding Projection

In `mongosh`, the `db.collection.find()` method offers a powerful feature called **projection** to control which fields are returned in the search results. This can significantly improve performance and reduce the amount of data transferred between the client and server, especially when dealing with large documents or collections.

- **Purpose:** Projection allows you to specify a document that acts as a filter, indicating which fields you want to include or exclude from the retrieved documents.
- **Syntax:**

```javascript
db.collection.find(query, { projection: { field1: 1, field2: 0, ... } })
```

- **Arguments:**
  - `query` (optional): The search criteria for selecting documents.
  - `projection` (optional): A document defining the projection behavior.
    - Include a field with a value of `1` to explicitly include that field in the results.
    - Include a field with a value of `0` to exclude that field from the results.
    - Use special operators like `_id: 0` to exclude the `_id` field (often included by default).
- **Example 1: Including Specific Fields:** retrieve all `passengers`, but only include `name` in the results

```javascript
// Find all passengers, only include name
// using toArray() to actually return an array will all passengers and not the cursor object
db.passengers.find({}, { name: 1 }).toArray();

// returns an array with all the passengers, only including the _id and name
// The _id is included by default, if we don't want to include it, we need to exclude it explicitly
[
  { _id: ObjectId("65e771312688b21c7d042257"), name: "Max Schwarzmueller" },
  { _id: ObjectId("65e771312688b21c7d042258"), name: "Manu Lorenz" },
  { _id: ObjectId("65e771312688b21c7d042259"), name: "Chris Hayton" },
  { _id: ObjectId("65e771312688b21c7d04225a"), name: "Sandeep Kumar" },
  { _id: ObjectId("65e771312688b21c7d04225b"), name: "Maria Jones" },
  { _id: ObjectId("65e771312688b21c7d04225c"), name: "Alexandra Maier" },
  { _id: ObjectId("65e771312688b21c7d04225d"), name: "Dr. Phil Evans" },
  { _id: ObjectId("65e771312688b21c7d04225e"), name: "Sandra Brugge" },
  { _id: ObjectId("65e771312688b21c7d04225f"), name: "Elisabeth Mayr" },
  { _id: ObjectId("65e771312688b21c7d042260"), name: "Frank Cube" },
  { _id: ObjectId("65e771312688b21c7d042261"), name: "Karandeep Alun" },
  { _id: ObjectId("65e771312688b21c7d042262"), name: "Michaela Drayer" },
  { _id: ObjectId("65e771312688b21c7d042263"), name: "Bernd Hoftstadt" },
  { _id: ObjectId("65e771312688b21c7d042264"), name: "Scott Tolib" },
  { _id: ObjectId("65e771312688b21c7d042265"), name: "Freddy Melver" },
  { _id: ObjectId("65e771312688b21c7d042266"), name: "Alexis Bohed" },
  { _id: ObjectId("65e771312688b21c7d042267"), name: "Melanie Palace" },
  { _id: ObjectId("65e771312688b21c7d042268"), name: "Armin Glutch" },
  { _id: ObjectId("65e771312688b21c7d042269"), name: "Klaus Arber" },
  { _id: ObjectId("65e771312688b21c7d04226a"), name: "Albert Twostone" },
  { _id: ObjectId("65e771312688b21c7d04226b"), name: "Gordon Black" },
];
```

- **Example 2: Excluding Specific Fields:**

```javascript
// Find all passagens, exclude the _id and age fields
db.passengers.find({}, { _id: 0, age: 0 }).toArray();

[
  { name: "Max Schwarzmueller" },
  { name: "Manu Lorenz" },
  { name: "Chris Hayton" },
  { name: "Sandeep Kumar" },
  { name: "Maria Jones" },
  { name: "Alexandra Maier" },
  { name: "Dr. Phil Evans" },
  { name: "Sandra Brugge" },
  { name: "Elisabeth Mayr" },
  { name: "Frank Cube" },
  { name: "Karandeep Alun" },
  { name: "Michaela Drayer" },
  { name: "Bernd Hoftstadt" },
  { name: "Scott Tolib" },
  { name: "Freddy Melver" },
  { name: "Alexis Bohed" },
  { name: "Melanie Palace" },
  { name: "Armin Glutch" },
  { name: "Klaus Arber" },
  { name: "Albert Twostone" },
  { name: "Gordon Black" },
];
```

This is similar to the `SELECT` command in **SQL** which allows us to pass certain columns to be returned in the result set:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM my_table -- return all columns
SELECT column_1, column_2 FROM my_table -- return only column_1 and column_2
```

**Key Points:**

- By default, if we don't specify a projection, all fields in the matching documents are returned.
- We can use a combination of inclusion (`1`) and exclusion (`0`) within the same projection document.
- Projection applies not only to top-level fields but also to nested documents and arrays within documents.

## Benefits of Using Projection

- **Reduced data transfer:** By excluding unnecessary fields, we minimize the amount of data transmitted between the client and server, improving performance and network bandwidth usage.
- **Enhanced readability:** Focusing on specific fields in the results can make them easier to read and work with in the application.
- **Security:** We can exclude sensitive fields from being returned in the results for security purposes.
