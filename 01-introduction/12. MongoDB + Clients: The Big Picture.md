# 12. MongoDB + Clients: The Big Picture

We might have an application that, through the MongoDB drivers, interact with the MongoDB server.

The MongoDB Server, after receiving the commands will pass them to the Storage Engine.

## What is a storage engine?

- The storage engine is a core component of MongoDB responsible for managing how data is stored and retrieved, both in memory and on disk. It defines the mechanisms by which MongoDB writes data, reads it back, and ensures consistency.

## How storage engines work

Each storage engine employs different strategies and provides distinct features, which directly affect database performance and behavior:

- **Data structure:** Storage engines determine how data is organized on disk, whether it's stored in document format, row format, or using some other mechanism.
- **Concurrency and locking:** Controls how multiple users or processes can access and modify data simultaneously, preventing conflicts and ensuring data consistency.
- **Memory management:** Influences how data is cached in memory to minimize disk access and improve read performance.
- **Indexing:** Some storage engines have specialized index structures to optimize query performance.
- **Compression:** May offer features to reduce the size of data on disk, saving storage space.

## MongoDB's Supported Storage Engines

MongoDB supports multiple storage engines. The most significant ones are:

- **WiredTiger (default):** The default storage engine since MongoDB 3.2. It provides document-level concurrency, compression, and robust data integrity with journaling.
- **In-Memory Storage Engine:** Designed for workloads where speed trumps data persistence. Data is stored entirely in memory, and any crashes or restarts will result in data loss.

## Choosing the right storage engine

The most suitable storage engine depends on your use case:

- **WiredTiger:** A great all-around choice for most applications, offering a balance of performance, data integrity, and compression.
- **In-Memory Storage Engine:** Use for scenarios requiring extremely low latency reads and writes, where persistence is less important (e.g., real-time analytics or temporary data storage).

- You can set a default storage engine server-wide or specify a storage engine on a per-collection basis.
