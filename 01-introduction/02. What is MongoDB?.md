# 2. What is MongoDB?

MongoDB is a NoSQL database solution that can be used in any type of application. The name came from the word Humongous, because it can store lots and lots of data.

In a MongoDB database we have **Collections**, which are the equivalent to tables in SQL databases, but they don't impose a strict schema. Within a collection we can have several **Documents**, which have JSON format.
