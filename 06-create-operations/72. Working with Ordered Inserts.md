# 72. Working with Ordered Inserts

When inserting multiple document with `insertMany*()` we can specify if the opereation is going to be ordered or not. If ordered is set to true and an insert fails, the server does not continue inserting records. If ordered is set to false and an insert fails, the server continues inserting records. By default, ordered is true.

```javascript
db.myCollection.insertMany(
  [
    { someKey: "Some value", antherKey: "Some other value" },
    { someKey: "Yet another value", antherKey: "Something else" },
  ],
  { ordered: false }
);

// If the first element fails the operation is going to continue and the second element is inserted.
// Whe ordered is true, the default, if an insertion fails the operations is stopped and no mora elements are inserted
```
